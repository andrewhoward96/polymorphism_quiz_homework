Polymorphism & Composition Homework - 
Quiz Polymorphism What does the word 'polymorphism' mean?.

Polymorphism is when a class can be treated as an instance of a parent class or interface rather than it's own class when required.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What does it mean when we apply polymorphism to OO design? Give a simple Java example?.

Grouping a selection of objects of different classes into an array list by means of a shared interface or parent class.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What can we use to implement polymorphism in Java?.

Inheritance through defining classes using the "extends" keyword, or interfaces using the "implements" keyword.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How many 'forms' can an object take when using polymorphism?.

As many as it has parent classes and interfaces.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Give an example of when you could use polymorphism?.

To group cars and motorbikes in an array list of vehicles.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Composition and Aggregation What do we mean by 'composition' in reference to object-oriented programming?.

Composition describes a "has a" relationship.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When would you use composition? Provide a simple example in Java?.

You would use composition when an object depends on another object to be implemented e.g. a house "has a" roof.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Give a difference between composition and aggregation?.

Composition creates a new instance of the depended class when an object is created, whereas abstraction utilises an already existing instance of the depended class - i.e. the depended class can exist independently of the dependent class.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is/are the advantages of using composition / aggregation?.

These allow objects to call methods on properties of the depended object and allows for greater complexity through single responsibility.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When using composition, when an object is destroyed, what happens to all the objects it is composed of?.

All of the objects it is composed of will be destroyed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When using aggregation, when an object is destroyed, what happens to all the objects it is composed of?.

The objects of which it was composed will persist.
